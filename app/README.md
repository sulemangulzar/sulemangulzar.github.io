# Next.js Dark Portfolio (JavaScript)


## Quick start
1. Create a new folder and paste the files above into the correct structure.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Replace EmailJS placeholders in `components/ContactForm.js` (SERVICE_ID, TEMPLATE_ID, USER_ID) or swap to your preferred backend.
4. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000`.


## Notes & Next steps
- This starter is intentionally dependency-light and written in JavaScript only (no TypeScript).
- It uses Framer Motion for micro-interactions and Tailwind for styles.
- To make this more unique we can:
- Add keyboard command palette (Ctrl+K)
- Pull GitHub commit history for an interactive timeline
- Add an AI assistant bubble (local JS chatbot or API)


Enjoy! Customize colors, fonts, and animations to make it uniquely yours.
